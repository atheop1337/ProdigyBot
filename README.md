# ProdigyBot
Telegram bot that allows users to manage projects and tasks, receive deadline notifications, divide tasks into subtasks, and share projects with other users. The bot should support multi-user mode, store data in SQLite using the `aiosqlite` asynchronous library, and integrate with a calendar for easy scheduling.
